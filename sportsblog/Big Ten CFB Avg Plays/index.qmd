The data shows that most Big Ten teams are running fewer offensive plays per game in 2025 rather than in 2024, supporting the idea that the NCAA's new timing rule that keeps the clock running after first downs, has shortened possessions. Maryland was the only team that saw a significant increase, most likely reflecting their upbeat offensive style. Overall, the rule change seems to have slightly reduced the pace of plays across the conference.
